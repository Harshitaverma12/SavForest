# SavForest
This project aims to use data analysis to predict the likelihood of a forest fire based on various attributes. The project used machine learning algorithms to analyze this data and identify patterns that can be used to predict future fire risks. This could be a valuable
tool for forest department personnel to proactively prevent and manage forest fires. In the future, the project could be merged with IoT sensors to allow for automatic measurement and
prediction of fire risks. This would further enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the prediction system.
